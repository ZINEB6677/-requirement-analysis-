# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Purpose of this Repository

This repository serves as the foundational blueprint for the **FeatureForge: Crafting Your Project Blueprint** project. Its primary purpose is to document, analyze, and structure the requirements for a booking management system, simulating a real-world software development scenario.

Here, we will master the principles of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) by:
*   Translating project needs into structured documentation.
*   Identifying and categorizing functional and non-functional requirements.
*   Creating visual representations of system interactions using diagrams.
*   Establishing clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.

This repository will contain all the necessary artifacts, including detailed requirement specifications, use case diagrams, and acceptance criteria, following industry-standard best practices.
